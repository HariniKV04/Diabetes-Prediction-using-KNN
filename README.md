## Diabetes-Prediction-using-KNN

This project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to build a predictive analysis model for diagnosing diabetes in patients involving several stages, including data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation.The project's objective is to develop a reliable and accurate predictive model using KNN that can aid in early diabetes diagnosis based on diagnostic measurements.
